# Image-Denoising

## 1. Description
There are three problems in this problem set. 

The first one is to prove the properties of convolution. 

The second one is to implement Frequency smoothing in three steps.
(1) Compute Fourier transform by using fft2 function and then center the low frequencies
(2) Keep different number of low frequencies but set all other high frequencies to 0
(3) Reconstruct the original image by ifft2 function

The third one is to implement gradient decent algorithm for ROF model with total variation minimization 

## 2. Result
The result and answer are reported in report.pdf file
